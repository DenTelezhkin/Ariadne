/// Type-erased wrapper for `ViewControllerBuilder`. It can be used to shorten `ViewControllerBuilder` signatures in cases, where generic type information is not needed by consumer of the Route.
/// Another reason to do this if this generic information obstructs your usage of `ViewControllerBuilder`s, for example in cases where you want to create a UITabBarController with array of builders, and each of them has completely different type. In this case, you can convert them to array of `AnyBuilder` objects.
///
/// For example, when using navigation view builder, signature can become pretty long - NavigationSingleViewEmbeddingBuilder<RouteBuilder<ProfileViewController>>. But generally, you don't really care about resulting type as long as it's type is ensured, and it is a UIViewController. In those cases, you could cast a builder like so:
/// `builder.asAnyBuilder`
/// which wraps builder in the `AnyBuilder`, which can be now used as return type that is much shorter.
public struct AnyBuilder: ViewControllerBuilder {

    /// Closure, that constructs `ViewController`.
    let builder: () throws -> ViewController

    /// Creates `AnyBuilder` instance.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - builder: builder, whose type is going to be erased.
    ///   - context: Context to be used when building `ViewController`
    public init<T: ViewControllerBuilder>(builder: T, context: T.Context) {
        self.builder = { try builder.build(with: context) }
    }

    /// Creates `AnyBuilder` instance
    /// - Parameter builder: builder, whose type is going to be erased.
    public init<T: ViewControllerBuilder>(builder: T) where T.Context == Void {
        self.builder = { try builder.build(with: ()) }
    }

    /// Creates `AnyBuilder` instance
    /// - Parameter buildingBy: closure to build `ViewController` when Route is executed.
    public init<T: ViewController>(buildingBy: @escaping () throws -> T) {
        self.builder = { try buildingBy() }
    }

    /// Builds `ViewController` by running `builder` closure.
    /// - Parameter context: context is always Void, because Builder and Context types have been erased and are unknown at this point.
    public func build(with context: ()) throws -> ViewController {
        return try builder()
    }
}
